Optio Blue - Dave's Dry Cleaners Application

About the program:

An interactive web application that displays several pages and includes forms throughout. The program was designed around an individual user to be able to create an account, sign in, and place orders for pickup and delivery of their dry cleaning.

Instructions: At the moment, the services page holds information and the other pages have some base content. However the sign in, login, and contact do not function correctly as originally thought out. The Orders page leads to an index order page where colored buttons give instruction to CRUD a basic dry cleaning order.

Future Enhancements:
Establish Google Auth and make personal accounts. Have a fully interactive order page of buttons and multiplier with a side display panel that shows a current order before selecting a date and time and sending the order.
